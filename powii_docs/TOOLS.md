# Tools
Currently, there is only one tool I have found that supports DATA and DICT files, which is Switch Toolbox. I will have to dig into it's code soon.
It appears the directory for NLG related things is https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox/tree/master/File_Format_Library/FileFormats/NLG
